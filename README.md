Performance budgets for websites - purpose, strategies

The purpose of a performance is budget is to set a group of limits to certain values that affect site performance. Two key factors to consider: page load time and bandwith. An important strategy most websites should incorporate is usage. Usage should be at the heart of any website design or redesign.

A performance budget doesn’t guide your decisions about what content should be displayed. Rather, it’s about how you choose to display that content. “Performance should be one of the first things a team considers in planning a website.”

Here are three things to consider when designing a webpage with a performance budget in mind:

One area that can affect performance is the type of graphics that are loaded and displayed on the webpage. Depending on how the webpage will be used you could use alternative methods that potentially use graphics that take up less size.

A second area that can affect performance is the type and amount of dynamic functionality is embedded into the site. Perhaps the dynamic capabilities can be loaded at the end of webpage rendering versus on load.

A third area that can affect performance is the amount of user feedback that is required from visitors. Do all of the questions that require answers need to be loaded into the initial page? Or can the questions be parceled out to the user as the user answers a group of questions on each page?

The value of a performance budget is that it provides a framework for discussions as you move forward. It serves as a point of reference as you decide what components should, and shouldn’t, get added to a page.

When loading styles onto a webpage, there are two questions to ask yourself and your answers will be based on your strategic approach and purpose of the webpage: 1. Is it better to lazy-load styles for breakpoints other than the current one? 2. Or should we rather load all the styles in one go?

One strategic approach is to set a total page size. Having a pre-defined ‘budget’ is a clear, tangible way to frame decisions about what can and can’t be included, and at a suitably early stage in the project. It can also potentially provide some justification to the client about why certain things have been omitted (or rather, swapped out for something else).
